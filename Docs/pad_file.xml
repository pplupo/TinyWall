			<Char_Desc_2000>TinyWall is a free, lightweight, and user-friendly firewall for Windows. It includes a unique combination of features that sets it apart from both commercial and freeware alternatives.

TinyWall does not display popups that insecurely urge users to grant applications network access. In fact, it will not notify you of any blocked action. Rather than displaying popups, TinyWall allows users to whitelist or unblock programs via various other methods easily. For example, you can just initiate whitelisting by a hotkey, then click on a window that you want to allow. Or, you can select an application from the list of running processes. Of course, the traditional way of selecting an executable also works.
This approach avoids popups but still keeps the firewall very easy to use. It will also limit the list of unblocked programs to those that the user really needs, which is optimal from a security standpoint, and does not let other applications pass even if they whitelist themselves in Windows' own firewall.

Other key features include:
- Very lightweight operation. Low RAM, CPU and disk impact.
- No drivers or kernel-components are installed so it does not influence system stability.
- Automatic learning, blocklists, password lock, firewall tampering protection and built-in tight firewall rules help increase TinyWall's and your computer's security even further.
- Boot-time filtering, promiscuous application filtering, and port scan protection.
- Explicit support for Windows Store and other UWP apps.
- Firewall modes and lots of other convenience features make TinyWall easy to use for anybody.
- All packed into a download that is barely more than a megabyte.
